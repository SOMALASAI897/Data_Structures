## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is a foundational skill in computer science and essential for technical interviews, problem-solving, and developing efficient software. This collection contains clear and well-commented C++ source code to help you learn, reference, and practice these concepts.

## Data Structures Covered

![Data Structures](images/data_structures.png)

- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly)
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary, AVL, etc.)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- Sets and Maps (via STL)

## Algorithms Covered

![Algorithms](images/algorithms.png)

- Sorting: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick Sort
- Searching: Linear Search, Binary Search
- Tree Traversals
- Graph Traversals: BFS, DFS
- Dynamic Programming (Fibonacci, Knapsack, etc.)
- Others as added

## How to Use

- All code is written in standard C++ (C++11 or higher).
- Each data structure or algorithm is organized in its own folder.
- Compile individual files using a C++ compiler, e.g.:
